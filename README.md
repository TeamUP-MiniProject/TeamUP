# GroupIT
A student written PWA for sharing location-based real world events with the world;
A way to subscribe to your interests and find partners outside your social circle. 
With GroupIT, you can create events under defined interest groups (i.e. a basketball game under the group "Basketball"), add a location, time and max. number of participants - and anyone subscribed to "Basketball", with their geo-filter radius coalescing with the events location, will get a notification and a chance to register to the event!
